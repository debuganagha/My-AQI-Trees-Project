# My-AQI-Trees-Project
This project explores the relationship between tree cover and air quality using bioclimatic variables and additional AQI data. By combining spatial plant species data with environmental and climatic factors, the aim is to create a model that recommends areas where deforestation would have minimal negative impact on air quality.
